## About ##

Forum consists in creating a web forum that allows :

- communication between users.
- associating categories to posts.
- liking and disliking posts and comments.
- filtering posts.

For more information, click [here](https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects/forum)


In this project (advanced-features) we will have to create a way to notify users when their posts are :

- liked/disliked
- commented
- You have to create an activity page that tracks the user own activity. In other words, a page that :

- Shows the user created posts
- Shows where the user left a like or a dislike
- Shows where and what the user has been commenting. For this, the comment will have to be shown, as well as the post commented
- You have to create a section where you will be able to Edit/Remove posts and comments..
